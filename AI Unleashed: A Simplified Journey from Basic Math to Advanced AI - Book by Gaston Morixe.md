## Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence (AI)! If you're holding this book, there's a good chance that you're fascinated by AI, and want to dive deep into it. Maybe you've seen movies with intelligent robots, or heard about self-driving cars, or maybe you're just curious about how YouTube seems to always know exactly what video to recommend next. But wherever your interest comes from, one thing is for sure: you're about to embark on an amazing journey.

Now, you might be thinking, "Wait a minute, I'm in high school. Isn't AI super complex? Don't I need to be some kind of mathematical genius to understand it?" Well, I'm here to tell you that while AI can be complex, it's not out of reach. In fact, much of AI is built on concepts that you might already be familiar with, like algebra and calculus. And as for being a genius, well, curiosity and persistence are far more important.

In this book, we're going to start from the basics and gradually work our way up. We'll begin with a refresher on some high school math topics. If you've ever wondered when you'd need to use that math in real life, you'll soon have your answer: right here, in understanding AI!

After that, we'll explore some more advanced math topics like calculus and linear algebra, but don't worry—we'll make it fun! You might think of these as dry, academic subjects, but I promise you they're not. Think of them as tools in a toolbox. The more tools you have, the more you can build, and we're going to build some amazing things.

Once we've got our mathematical tools, we'll dive into the heart of AI: machine learning. We'll learn about different types of learning, like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. It's kind of like how a dog learns to fetch, but instead, it's a computer learning to recognize faces, play games, translate languages, and more!

From there, we'll venture into deep learning, where we'll meet artificial neural networks. Don't let the name intimidate you—they're just inspired by how our brains work. We'll start with simple ones and gradually move on to more advanced ones, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are great at tasks like image recognition, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which excel at understanding language.

Finally, we'll explore some of the latest advancements in AI, like transformers, attention mechanisms, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). It might all sound like science fiction, but it's not. It's real, it's happening now, and by the end of this book, you'll understand how it all works.

Along the way, there will be plenty of examples, analogies, and exercises to help you understand and apply what you've learned. So don't worry if you don't get everything right away. Just keep going, keep exploring, keep asking questions. That's how learning works, and that's how you become an expert.

So, are you ready to dive in and explore the incredible world of AI? Let's get started!

Remember: AI isn't magic. It's just math, and with this book, you'll be able to unlock its secrets. So buckle up, and let's embark on this exciting journey together!
